      Today I will be discussing what the benefits of using Ruby Classes are. To start off, Ruby as a language is one that is supposed to make the user happy. How does it do that? Well, for one, the code is much easier to read in Ruby than other languages. It can also be significantly shorter to do the same programs. This introduces our friend classes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Classes in Ruby make the code much more readable. If we didn't use classes, we would have to write a lot of our code into one method. This can cause issues in debugging, readability, technical, etc. Classes allow the user to break up methods into simpler and easier to read code that will execute all of it, when an instance class is called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instance variables are also highly recommended. This gives you access to variables that you are able to use in different methods and not just the method it was initialized in. So instead of having a different empty variable to point to the same thing in each method, you can have one variable to point to one thing for all your methods.
