      Learning Ruby arrays can be frustrating. I know for me, it took me a long time to figure out what was going on in an array. However, they are extremely useful when mastered. They help create lists, order objects, and give the code a much cleaner look. Think of it like your To-Do list, only written in code! To create an array we use "[]"  square brackets. You can put almost anything inside arrays. So for example,
    <code>
      <p>my_array = ["water", "gatorade" , "tea"]
    </code>

    </p>
    <p>
       As you can see from the from the example above, my array has 3 objects. So the array saved my objects that I can call anytime I want. But this doesn't really show me much besides their names. What if I wanted to be a little more specific? What if I wanted to who really likes these beverages and categorize their names on their favorite one? Well, I can do that. We can use something called a "hash".
    </p>

        Hashes are awesome. Think of them like a dictionary. You can look up a word(object) and then it will tell you the meaning(value) of that word. To make a hash we use {} curly brackets. So for example,

    <code>
      <p>my_hash = {"water" => "Eric", "gatorade" => "Kevin", "tea" => "Mom"}
      </code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now what if you wanted to know about specific information out of an array or hash? We can search for them instead of calling out the entire list everytime. To do this, we can call an "index number" to show our specific info.

      <code>
        <p>my_array[0] => "water"
        </code>

        <p>Index numbers ALWAYS start with the number 0.They never start at 1. And there you go! Now you know how to make arrays and hashes!
