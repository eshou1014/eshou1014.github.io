  <h1>Enumerables: Map</h1>

      Map enumerables are used to return an array with the results of running the code block once for every element. So for example
    <code>
      <p>[1,2,3].map {|i| i*i}
        => 1,4,9
    </code>

    </p>
    <p>
       As you can see from the from the example above, I multiplied everything inside the array by itself. This means that if I inputted a "1" then it would multiplt 1*1. Maps are extremely useful for iterating over arrays and hashes. They provide code that is clean and non repetitive. They can also be very fun and helps when you need different inputs to do similar things.

        I find them to be particularly useful when dealing with integers. You can probably also use hem for strings, but I think they get a little more complex with the spacing for strings.
