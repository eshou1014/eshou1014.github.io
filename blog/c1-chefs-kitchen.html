      My take on the DBC experience so far is great! Honestly, I never thought I would be able to learn programming. The mindset is so different from other ways of learning that I feel I can actually grow and learn how to code. My impression of DBC is that they are different in how they approach not just how to code, but how to LEARN. In the video, it discusses the difference between KITCHEN vs RESTAURANT. It states that we are all chefs and we will all make a mess in the kitchen in order to learn how to properly do things right. The restaurant is how a lot of Western ideals are thought upon. Such as seeing DBC as a "package" deal instead of a life long commitment and network.

      I see myself interacting with my cohort and professors. I see myself getting mad and frustrated at the challenges, but willing to press on. I see myself asking questions to gain knowledge. I see myself pushing my brain to the absolute limit. I see myself giving feedback to others and receiving it in order to further my education. But most importantly, I see myself growing as a person. My expectations of DBC have not changed since this week. It has been fun to learn and I know that it will not only continue to challenge me, but also it will get harder. And I am perfectly fine with that.

      I am truly excited to be learning in this environment. To have fellow students rising and challenging themselves, it only gives me inspiration to try harder. It does make me a bit nervous but honestly, that is not a bad thing. We all will get through it together and in the end, it will make us stronger as a whole. I am looking forward to these 9 weeks.
