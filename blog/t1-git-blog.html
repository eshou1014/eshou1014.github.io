      Hey there! Today I will be discussing what the benefits of having version control are. To start off let me ask you a question. If you were playing a brand new video game and couldn't save throughout any point in the game, would you think that is a fun game to play? The answer for 99.9% of you would be "NO". This is what version control is. It is basically a checkpoint in a video game that you can access if you let's say died or messed up during an earlier period of your game. It helps you track your progress and see how far you've come. It also works well as a backup in case anything does go wrong, you have another file somewhere to go back to. That is why version control is super important when you are working on a project. You never know what might happen!

      Git helps you keep track of your progress by letting you browse through the commit log. This log shows every single commit to that project/branch and lets the user write a message so that they can remember what they committed that time. This is extremely useful because the log is able to keep track of every earlier commit that you have made. It makes it invaluable if there is an emergency.

      Github is a great resource because it is open source. It is a free computer program that anybody can modify. It is great to use because it allows hundreds of people to work on one single project and keeps the code nice and orderely. It also makes it so your code is nice and secure on a server that is not your local machine. Github is extremely useful in teams and being able to commit on changing the code with hundreds of people is something that you want to keep track off.
