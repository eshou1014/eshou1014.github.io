      This week was a rollercoaster. From confusion to epiphanies to frustrations, I feel my knowledge of HTML/CSS has improved greatly. While I did learn a significant amount of information this week, in this blog post I will focus on one element, the "position" tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      The position tag is used for positioning elements of the html content. It has four properties. absolute, fixed, relative, and static. These all effect the content differently. Absolute is used when someone needs to position something relative to the first element in the html file. So for example, if you have a header and some text inside it, then you can use the absolute to make it so it is under the header.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fixed property is how the element looks relative to the browser window. So for example, if I want an element to look the same no matter which device/web browser they use, I would use fixed to make sure it is always where it needs to be inside the html page.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relative property is used when you want an element to be relative to its normal position. So for example if an element is on the right side, i can use the relative property and then specify I want to add 20pixels to the left side to make it move LEFT. EX. "left:20px" will move it to the LEFT.
    </p>
    <p>
      The static property is used when you want it to be in order. It will appear in the browser how the html file is laid out. It is based on the document and where it is inside the html file.
