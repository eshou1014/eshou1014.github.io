      Upon researching about stereotype threat, it gave me a clear idea of how it impacts students and learning in general. This actually happened to me a lot when I was in highschool/college. Asians are always emphasized as being smart certain subjects, particularly math.

      As a student, people would often come up to me and ask me questions on math problems. This put a great deal of unnecessary responsibility on me because if I did not know the answer, they would often tease me as an asian who does not know math. This led to lower grades in my math classes because I felt that my racial identity was connected to my academic ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is still an ongoing issue in many public as well as private schools. I believe that principals and school communities should address this issue by openly talking about it and raising an alarm to students who are known to cause this sort of behavior.
