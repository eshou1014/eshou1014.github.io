      Computer memory is any physical device capable of storing information temporarily or permanently. RAM is a volatile memory that stores information on an integrated circuit used by the OS, software, and hardware. There are many common types of RAM, EDO, SDRAM, and DDRM 1-4.

      Memory and Storage are different concepts. RAM can be considered memory because it is the primary memory while storage is refered to as storage. When a program such as your Internet browser is open, it is loaded from your hard drive and placed into RAM, which allows that program to communicate with the processor at higher speeds. Anything you save to your computer, such as a picture or video, is sent to your hard drive for storage.
