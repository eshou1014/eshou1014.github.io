  <h1>Tech Issues: Security</h1>

      One of my biggest concerns as technology becomes more advanced is the idea of "security". It used to be that if an individual wants to be alone, they can do so in the comfort of their own home. They had a secure place where nothing would be able to bother them. With the advancement of devices and phones, security is nothing but an idea that is being replaced. It is literally being "deleted" from the dictionary because of the way we work  now. We have become so accustomed to giving people our data such as where we've been, where we're heading for vacation, where we just ate, etc. that being "alone" is not possible anymore. Details about someone are right at our fingertips. Plus there's the fact that our phones save and use our location for everything.

      Technology does a lot of great things. They make people's lives easier and makes information readily available. Technology also creates social networks to interact with so many different people. I think the consequence of this is the fact that we no longer can be without our data. Who we are, what we do, are all stored on server infos. Some poeple talk about wanting anonymous browsing and using apps and I believe that this may be a possible solution to the security problem.
