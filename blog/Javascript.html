      This week I worked with a new language called JavaScript. I was a bit disappointed when I found out we were not going to be working in Ruby anymore because the language was starting to make sense and was becoming a lot of fun. Nevertheless, this week I dove straight into our new coding buddy. It was a bit overwhelming at first because the syntax felt a lot more unfamiliar. The transition from understanding Ruby to Javascript was pretty significant. For the first few days, adjusting took hours of research to do the same thing. Specifically, I'm going to talk about the difference in the way they loop.

      In Ruby, when we wanted to iterate over an object, we would use the EACH method, like so,
      <code>
      <p>my_array.each {|x| puts x}
    </code>
    <br>
      This was simple to understand. In Javascript, to do the same thing we would do this,
      <br>
      <code>
      <p>for(i = 0; i < object.length; i++)
          console.log(object)
    </code>
    <br>
      You can see the difference is pretty darn big. This syntax was confusing to no end when I first started learning Javascript. I always wondered, why couldn't Javascript be more elegant? Why did it feel so 'old'? And then I read the book required and I understood, because Javascript is inherently as old as the internet itself.
