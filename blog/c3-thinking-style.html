      My thinking style is Concrete Random. I use a lot of trial-and-error type solutions to my challenges and it helps me learn the best. The biggest struggle for me so far is when I do not have references or experts guiding me through an exercise that I falter. I found the html/css syntax to be way easier than the Ruby syntax. I could not understand the exercises either for Ruby because I felt so poor in my knowledge. I believe this is due to the way I think. I want to be able to reach out for help more and try working in more group settings to see if that will help me learn better.

      I feel like the best mindset for learning is to just be open. Be open to everything. What I mean by that is be open to feedback, criticism, changes, success of others, and use all that to better yourself. There is no reason to believe that you are better than someone else and feel the need to put others down. You should help them succeed because there is always something new that you can learn from others. From now on, I will start asking others for more help on challenges I face and try to give more feedback to help them grow as well.
