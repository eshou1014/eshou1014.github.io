      Hey everyone! My name is Eric Shou. I'm originally from Hangzhou, China but moved to the U.S. when I was four years old. I grew up in NJ throughout my childhood and went to Chicago for college.

      My main interest right now is video games. I've loved playing them since I was really young and it was just something that grew up with me. I do have a lot of different hobbies though which include guitar, weightlifting, boxing, and now coding.

      The farthest education that I received is my college education. I went to DePaul University in Chicago, IL. I majored in Computer Game Development with a concentration in production/design. It taught me a great deal about development in general and working as a team. However, it did not teach me enough technical skills I needed such as c++, level editors, and scripts.

      Something quirky about me. If I think about it, the quirkiest thing about me is that I always want to meet new people. No matter who they are, as long as they are a decent person, I would love to have a conversation with them.
